# After 3 Years, I Failed. Here's All My Startup's Code.


And by "all," I mean everything: core product, failed pivots, miscellaneous
scripts, deployment configurations, marketing website, and more. Hopefully the
codebase is interesting or potentially helpful to somebody out there!

## The Startup

Konfig was a developer tools startup focused on making API integrations easier.
We started in late 2022 with the mission of simplifying how developers work with
APIs by providing better tooling around SDK generation, documentation, and
testing.

Our main product was an SDK Generator that could take any OpenAPI specification
and generate high-quality client libraries in multiple programming languages. We
expanded this with additional tools for API documentation and interactive API
testing environments.

While we gained some traction with some startups, we ultimately weren't able to
build a hyper-growth business. It was too difficult to get potential customers to
sign contracts with us and that price points were too low despite the
demonstrably ROI. We then decided to pivot into a vertical B2B SaaS AI product
because we felt we could use the breakthroughs in Gen AI to solve previously
unsolvable problems, but after going through user interviews and the sales cycle
for many different ideas, we haven't been able to find enough traction to make
us believe that we were on the right track to build a huge business.

Despite the outcome, we're proud of the technology we built and believe our work
could be helpful for others. That's why we're open-sourcing our entire codebase.

## The Repo

Here is the public [GitHub repo](https://github.com/konfig-dev/konfig). I'm releasing it exactly as it was when we shut down—no cleanup, no polishing, no modifications. This is our startup's codebase in its true, unfiltered form.

## Thank You

I want to express my deepest gratitude to everyone who supported us on this
journey. To our investors who believed in our vision and backed us financially,
thank you for taking a chance on us. To our customers who trusted us with their
business and provided invaluable feedback, you helped shape our products and
understanding of the market. And to Eddie and Anh-Tuan, my incredible
teammates—thank you for your dedication, hard work, and partnership through all
the ups and downs. Your contributions made this startup journey not just
possible, but truly meaningful and worthwhile.

Looking back to March 2022 when I left my job to pursue this startup full-time,
I have absolutely no regrets. I knew the risks—that failure was a very real
possibility—but I also knew I had to take this chance. Today, even as we close
this chapter, I'm grateful for the failure because it has taught me more than
success ever could. The experience has been transformative, showing me what I'm
capable of and what I still need to learn.

As for what's next, I'm excited to explore new opportunities, see where the job
market thinks I fit (haha), and continue learning and growing. Who knows? Maybe
someday I'll take another shot at building something of my own. But for now, I'm
thankful for the journey, the lessons learned, and the relationships built. This
experience has been invaluable, and I'm grateful for everyone involved.
