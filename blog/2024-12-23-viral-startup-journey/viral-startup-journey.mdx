# 100K Views, 1K GitHub Stars, and 100+ Messages Later

Recently I shared my [startup journey](/blog/closing-my-startup) on LinkedIn. In
particular, I shared the source code for my startup after closing it down along
with the story of building and shutting down the company. Ordinarily, I got an
above-average response from my personal network since it was big career news for
me. But as I woke up the next day, I saw a pull request on the open source repo
asking to license the code—which was weird because I didn't think anybody would
actually care about a failed startup's codebase.

Similarly weird, there were ~50 stars on the repo. Curious about where this sudden
attention was coming from, I checked my website analytics and noticed a surge of
traffic from both Hacker News and Reddit. Someone had discovered my post and
shared it on both platforms where it quickly gained traction. Over the next 6
days, my story reached over 100,000 readers, I received more than 100
recruitment messages, and the GitHub repo accumulated over 1,000 stars. What
started as a simple LinkedIn post about my startup journey had organically spread
to [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1hg9mu3/after_3_years_i_failed_heres_all_my_startups_code/)
and [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42440886), sparking
discussions in both communities.

## Reflection

While betting on myself didn't work out financially, the overwhelming response
to sharing my journey has given me a unique sense of validation I've never felt
before in my career. The way my story resonated with the tech community—from
complete strangers to old colleagues—tells me that the skills and experiences I
gained over these 3 years are genuinely valuable. Sure, it's just social
validation, but seeing my post hit the front page of Hacker News and
/r/programming suggests that my experience building and shutting down a startup
resonates deeply with other engineers. When I look at my refreshed resume now, I
see more than just another failed startup—I recall the experience of shipping
products, pivoting through market changes, and learning hard lessons about what
it takes to build something from scratch. In hindsight, what felt like an ending
when we decided to shut down might just be another stepping stone in my career.
