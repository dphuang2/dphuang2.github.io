# I Built My Resume In Markdown

Recently unemployed [(see why)](/blog/closing-my-startup), so I need to create a
resume which I haven't done in 6 years, since the beginning of 2019 (when I
graudated college). That being said, it was time to make one crucial system
design decision, how am I going to make it. I could use good-ol Microsoft Word,
choose a template, and run with it. Or...I could leverage my big brain
engineering experience to devise a more robust and portable solution. One that
is:

1. Easy to maintain.
2. Does not require messing around with clanky word processing software.
3. Lets me just put my content to file without thinking about any of the formatting.

After a couple years of online content creation and software engineering, i've
never found something more simple yet feature-complete as markdown for authoring
content. Previously i've built my resume using LaTex and a template
([iykyk](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume)), but after looking back at the
source for that resume, I just don't want to dive back into writing LaTex. Its
great, but not nearly as simple as Markdown. I did a quick [Perplexity
search](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/markdown-based-resume-builder-Ev.04RITRd2Ehyy3r1l2Ig#0)
which led me to a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/vidluther/markdown-resume)
showing how to use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert Markdown to HTML.
Then you can use one of many HTML to PDF tools along with your own custom `.css` file to
produce a final PDF.

## The Workflow

The entire workflow consists of one shell script to run two commands.

```shell title="generate-pdf.sh"
#!/bin/sh

# Generate HTML first
pandoc resume.md -f markdown -t html -c resume-stylesheet.css -s -o resume.html
# Use puppeteer to convert HTML to PDF
node generate-pdf.js
```

Here is a the JavaScript to kick off a headless puppeteer browser to export the HTML to PDF.

```javascript title="generate-pdf.js"
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");

async function generatePDF() {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto(`file://${process.cwd()}/resume.html`, {
    waitUntil: "networkidle0",
  });
  await page.pdf({
    path: "resume.pdf",
    format: "A4",
    printBackground: true,
    preferCSSPageSize: true,
    margin: {
      top: "1cm",
      right: "1cm",
      bottom: "1cm",
      left: "1cm",
    },
  });
  await browser.close();
}

generatePDF();
```

Checkout the output [here](/resume.pdf) and the source markdown
[here](https://github.com/dphuang2/dphuang2.github.io/blob/main/markdown-resume/resume.md).
You can also checkout the custom `.css` file I used, its simple and classic. I
tried not to stray too far away from traditional resume styling but adde a
little but of fundamentals from refactoring UI, primarily about visual hierachy
and spacing.
