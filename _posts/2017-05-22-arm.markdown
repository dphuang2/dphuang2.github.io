### Task 1 - Duration: 1 Week
Read documentation on how to run a benchmark, setup git, and mechanics of Juju
(anatomy of a charm)

### Task 2 - Duration: 1 Week
Flash Mellanox NICS with updated firmware and confirm that it can PXE boot. This
required a lot of ipmitool, bash scripts, and reading Mellanox documentation.

### Task 3 - Duration: ~3 Weeks 
Re-write software infrastructure to be compatible with newer version of Juju.
This meant re-writing the entire Python codebase that automates the recreations
of benchmarks on readily deployable machines in a server lab to be compatible
with a newer version of Juju (the team's deployment system). In addition to
re-writing for newer software infrastructure, my job was also to migrate
the code to Python 3.
