### Task 1 - Duration: 1 Week
Read documentation on how to run a benchmark, setup Git/Gerrit pre-commit hooks,
and learn the mechanics of Juju (anatomy of a charm).

### Task 2 - Duration: 1 Week
Flash Mellanox NICs with updated firmware and confirm that it can PXE boot. This
required a lot of ipmitool, bash scripts, and reading Mellanox documentation.

### Task 3 - Duration: ~8 Weeks 
Re-write software infrastructure to be compatible with newer version of Juju.
This meant re-writing almost the entire Python codebase that automates the
recreations of benchmarks on readily deployable machines in a server lab to be
compatible with a newer version of Juju (the team's deployment system). In
addition to re-writing for newer software infrastructure, my job was also to
migrate the code to Python 3, document the whole process, design changes to a
team of 25 people.

### Task 4 - Duration: ~4 Weeks
Create software to automate flake8/pylint codestyling on Gerrit patch set
updates and provide in-line feedback on the Gerrit front-end.  This was
accomplished through the use of Jenkins and about ~400 lines of Python
automation code. This task required a lot of string parsing (Regex), reading
Gerrit API Docs, and desigining a well-engineered process for auto-linting.

### Task 5 - Duration: ~3 Weeks
Designing algorithm to estimate benchmark run times given a yaml
experiment file. Thought of idea to use chi-squared independence test to
decrease estimation time by an average of around 700%

### Important skills learned/improved:
 - Software Development Life cycle - Research/Learning, Development, Code Review Process
 - Strong Coding/Scripting Skills
 - Python, Bash/Shell scripting
 - Continuous Integration with Jenkins
 - Using statistical tests to increase efficiency of calculations
 - Oral Presentation Skills
 - Computer architecture and Workload Analysis
