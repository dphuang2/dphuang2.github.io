[pogobag](https://pogobag.me) is a web application that I personally built with Ruby on Rails. It interfaces with an unofficial Pokemon Go API to extract data, analyze pokemon attributes, and display them on a response and easy to access website. In the first two weeks of my first deployment, this website went viral hitting 210,000+ unique users and 3,304,043 Page views in two weeks.

The project is open-sourced and the Github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/dphuang2/PoGoBag).
