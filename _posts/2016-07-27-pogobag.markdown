pogobag.me is a web application that I personally built with Ruby on Rails. It
interfaces with an unofficial Pokemon Go API to extract data, analyze pokemon
attributes, and display them on a responsive and easy to access website. In the
first two weeks of my first deployment, this website went viral hitting 210,000+
unique users and 3,304,043 Page views in two weeks. As of December 1, 2016 it
yields 173 Stars, 71 Issues, and 30 Pull Requests.

The project is open-sourced and the Github repo can be found
[here](https://github.com/dphuang2/PoGoBag).
