While pledging for Theta Tau a group of 9 students and I are running a
fundraiser for Camp Quality, a charity that helps kids with cancer, by
delivering breakfast food to students the morning after Unofficial!

On Wednesday, March 1, 2017, we were featured in an online article in the local
news. I was the main point of contact and was quoted throughout the article.

Update 3/6/2017 (Monday after fundraiser): Looks like the local senator approved
of our fundraiser!
