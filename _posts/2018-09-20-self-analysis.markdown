# Why?

For my [TE 466](https://tec.illinois.edu/academics/course/TE466) self-branding
assignment, I will be performing a self-analysis of myself. To begin, I will do
a strength/weakness analysis of myself in the form of a table. Then I am going
to ask myself the following questions: 

1. "What are the attributes/characteristics that make me distinctive from my colleagues or
competitors?
2. What is my strong suit? What needs improvement?". 

| Strength                    | Weakness
|--------------------         |---------------------
| Hard-working                | Stubborn
| Passionate                  | Picky
| Friendly                    | Impostor Syndrome
| Quick learner               | Impatient
| Strong technical background |
| Natural leader              |
