# Why?

For my [TE 466](https://tec.illinois.edu/academics/course/TE466) self-branding
assignment, I will be performing a self-analysis. To begin, I will do a
strength/weakness analysis of myself in the form of a table and
explanation/thoughts. Then I am going to ask myself the following questions: 

1. "What are the attributes/characteristics that make me distinctive from my colleagues or
competitors?
2. What is my strong suit? What needs improvement?". 

I will then do an external informal survey of my friends and family by asking
them what they think my strengths, weaknesses, attributes, characteristics are.
I will take the results from this survey and perform a congruence analysis . I
will then create a feature-benefit model of myself that reflects my personal
brand.

# Strengths and Weaknesses 

Doing a strength/weakness analysis of myself was difficult. Not only do you have
have a level of self-confidence to think about your strengths, but you also have
to have the self-awareness to expose your own weaknesses in writing.
Nevertheless, I put on my self-reflecting cap and wrote anything that came to
mind. I feel that the strengths/weakness chart that I wrote were indicative of
how I think of myself. The following table contains a list of my proposed
strengths and weaknesses. I will first explain each strength one-by-one and then
explore my weaknesses after.

| Strength                          | Weakness
|--------------------               |---------------------
| Hard-working                      | Stubborn
| Passionate                        | Picky
| Quick learner                     | Impatient
| Friendly                          | Impostor Syndrome
| Strong technical background       |
| Natural leader / Takes Initiative |

## Strengths

Strengths are what make you qualified for a job, better than the next candidate,
and excel in the workforce. I believe that the strengths that I proposed have
been demonstrated many times in my college career or industry experience.

 - As a *hard-working* person, I find myself making sure that the job gets done
   regardless of how much work is needed to be done. If it means I have to
   forego sleep or work during breaks to get the job done, I will see to it that
   it gets accomplished. I believe this strength of mine is a product of my
   upbringing and values taught as a child.
 - I am *passionate* about technology. Passion drives me to continuously
   self-improve my technical expertise and mindset. Even if working on a project
   does not yield me any money or A on my transcript, I often find myself
   learning and making things regardless of their reward.
 - The ability to *quickly learn* something finds itself useful is a myriad of
   ways. Whether it be working on a foreign task at work or taking a class on an
   entirely new subject, my ability to quickly learn a field or subject has
   proven to be one of my most helpful strengths. I believe that if someone does
   not know much but is a quick learner, they will be more successful than
   someone who already knows a lot but is a slow learner.
 - Being *friendly* is a virtue of mine. I believe it is important to treat others
   the way you want to be treated. This especially applies in the workplace as
   it is important to foster nurturing relationships with your coworkers rather
   than detrimental ones. 
 - Having a *strong technical background* is simply a function of my passion and
   hard-working attitude. As I choose to work hard on subjects or fields that I
   am passionate about, my technical background directly benefits.
 - Although being a *natural leader* is something that I do not try to portray
   myself. I often find myself in situations where the decision to take the
   initiative as a leader comes natural. I think this is a strength that I do
   not take advantage of as much as I would like. 

## Weaknesses

Weaknesses are things that I felt that I should improve on. These are the things
that I feel do not necessarily define me, but make it harder for me to excel on
the job. And almost all of them have to do with a specific negative mindset.
They are all things that I would love to improve on but I understand take time
to train. 

# External Analysis

After interviewing a dozen of friends and a few family members, I came up with a
summary of myself based on other people's perspective. The general consensus was
that I was a really hard-worker with the motivation to do some pretty great
things in the future. This was mainly due to a proven track-record of working
hard and doing difficult things. Whether it was taking a lot of classes, going
the extra mile at work, or working on a lot of personal projects, my peers felt
that I had the qualities of a hard worker. I was very proud of this strength and
I think it is a quality that differentiates me from other people. I also found
out that most people think that I can be stubborn. This analysis did not
surprise me as I expected this weakness to be obvious in my character. There has
been many situations where I believed my idea or method was superior without
taking into the account the ideas or methods of others. This is something that I
recognize and am always working on and I believe has drastically improved during
my time in college.

# Congruence Analysis

I was lucky to find that my friends and family's perspectives of me aligned with
my self-analysis.
