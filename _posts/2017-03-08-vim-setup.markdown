Vim has become an essential part of my development workflow. I started using Vim
in the Summer of 2016 while working for a remote internship. Since I had the
opportunity to spend time and learn something new, I decided that Vim was the
next thing that I wanted to learn. It was a great decision that has lead me to
become a more efficient coder. I became addicted to Vim so much that I created a
small little
[script](https://github.com/dphuang2/dotfiles/blob/master/setupvim.sh) to set up
my .vimrc and plugins on the engineering workstation at school. This script was
especially helpful when I had to work on ECE 391 in the lab!

My favorite plugins are (ordered by use):
- [ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/ctrlpvim/ctrlp.vim) - Fuzzy finder
- [scrooloose/nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) - File explorer
- [tpop/vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) - Easy surroundings
  in pairs
- [jiangmiao/auto-pairs](https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs) - Auto insert
  and delete pairs
- [justinmk/vim-sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak) - Jump to any
  location specified by two characters

<br> Here is also a link to my personal .vimrc that I have refined over the past
10 months:

Also, I have unfortunately become a vim memer over time: ![Vim
