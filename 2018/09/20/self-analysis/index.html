          <h1 id="why-and-how">Why and How?</h1>

<p>For my <a href="https://tec.illinois.edu/academics/course/TE466">TE 466</a> self-branding
assignment, I will be performing a self-analysis. To begin, I will do a
strength/weakness analysis of myself in the form of a table with
explanation/thoughts.  I will then do an external informal survey of my friends
and family by asking them to list my strengths, weaknesses, attributes,
characteristics.  I will take the results from this survey and perform a
congruence analysis . I will then create a feature-benefit model of myself that
reflects my personal brand.</p>

<h1 id="strengths-and-weaknesses">Strengths and Weaknesses</h1>

<p>Doing a strength/weakness analysis of myself was difficult. Not only do you have
to have a level of self-confidence to think about your strengths, but you also have
to have the self-awareness to expose your own weaknesses in writing.
Nevertheless, I put on my self-reflecting cap and wrote anything that came to
mind. I feel that the strengths/weakness chart that I wrote were indicative of
how I think of myself. The following table contains a list of my proposed
strengths and weaknesses. I will first explain each strength one-by-one and then
explore my weaknesses after.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Strength</th>
      <th>Weakness</th>
    </tr>

      <td>Quick learner</td>
      <td>Impatient</td>

<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>

<p>Strengths are what make you qualified for a job, better than the next candidate,
and excel in the workforce. I believe that the strengths that I analyzed have
been demonstrated in my college career or industry experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>As a <strong>hard-working</strong> person, I find myself making sure that the job gets
done regardless of how much work is needed to be done. If it means I have to
forego sleep or work during breaks to get the job done, I will see to it that
it gets accomplished. I believe my hard-working attitude is a product of my
upbringing and values that I was taught as a child</li>
  <li>I am <strong>passionate</strong> about technology. Passion drives me to continuously
self-improve my technical expertise and mindset. Even if working on a project
does not yield me any money or “A” on my transcript, I often find myself
learning and making things regardless of their reward.</li>
  <li>The ability to <strong>quickly learn</strong> something finds itself useful is a myriad of
ways. Whether it be working on a foreign task at work or taking a class on an
entirely new subject, my ability to quickly learn a field or subject has
proven to be one of my most helpful strengths. I believe that if someone does
not know much but is a quick learner, they will be more successful than
someone who already knows a lot but is a slow learner.</li>
  <li>Being <strong>friendly</strong> is a virtue of mine. I believe it is important to treat others
the way you want to be treated. This especially applies in the workplace as
it is important to foster nurturing relationships with your coworkers rather
than detrimental ones.</li>
  <li>Having a <strong>strong technical background</strong> is simply a function of my passion and
hard-working attitude. As I choose to work hard on subjects or fields that I
am passionate about, my technical background directly benefits.</li>
  <li>Although being a <strong>natural leader</strong> is not obvious to me, I often find myself
in situations where the decision to take the initiative as a leader comes
natural.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>

<p>Weaknesses are things that I felt that I should improve on. These are the things
that I feel do not necessarily define me, but make it harder for me to excel on
the job. My most interesting weakness is impostor syndrome. I strongly believe
everyone has the potential to do great work, but it is a matter of their ability
to hone their strengths and make them useful. The impostor syndrome is a
psychological pattern in which individuals doubt their accomplishments and have
a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a “fraud”. Although I do not
think this is a devastating weakness of mine, it still requires careful thought.
I often find myself doubting my ability to accomplish a task and need to realign
my perspective to motivate myself.  The following diagram does a great job of
explaining this phenomenon.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/image/impostorsyndrome.png" alt="Impostor Syndrome" /></p>

<h1 id="external-analysis">External Analysis</h1>

<p>After interviewing a dozen of friends and a few family members, I came up with a
summary of myself based on other people’s perspective. The general consensus was
that I was a really hard-worker with lots of self-motivation. This was mainly
due to a proven track-record of working hard and doing difficult things. Whether
it was taking a lot of classes, going the extra mile at work, or working on a
lot of personal projects, my peers felt that I had the qualities of a hard
worker. I was very proud of this strength and I think it is a quality that
differentiates me from other people. Another strength that aligned was my
friendliness. My peers felt that I was generally a friendly and thoughtful
person based on anecdotal experiences. I also found out that most people think
that I can be stubborn. This observation did not surprise me as stubbornness is
an obvious character of mine. I can think of multiple situations where I
believed my idea or method was superior without considering the ideas or methods
of others. This is something I am always working on and feel has drastically
improved during my time in college. No one mentioned anything about impostor
syndrome or impatience. I was not surprised that no one mentioned impostor
syndrome as it is an internal psychological phenomena that is not outwardly
obvious. But I was surprised that no one mentioned my impatience. I know from
experience that I tend to get impatient when it comes to results or finding
solutions—maybe it is a sign of improvement.</p>

<h1 id="congruence-analysis">Congruence Analysis</h1>

<p>I was lucky to find that my friends and family’s perspectives of me aligned with
my self-analysis. I think this is a testament to some of my self-awareness but
obviously requires a larger sample size to truly determine the reality of other
people’s perspectives. I also think it is hard for friends/family to write about
your weaknesses without exposing too much about what they think of you.</p>
