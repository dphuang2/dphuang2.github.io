          <h2 id="initial-fears">Initial fears</h2>
<p>There is so much to do in this world and so much that makes us humans so unique.
Music, dance, film, stories, culture, attraction, love, fear…the list goes on.
Every time I watch someone who is so good at what they do, I get so inspired to
do the same but remember that we only have one lifetime to make the best of our
energy. At the moment it feels like I focus on software and computers but a part
of me feels like focusing my energy on making computers do work for us seems,
dare I say it, boring and soulless. The things that we experience and people
that we surround ourselves from early on in our life really affect the passions
that we pursue. I think this has really affected my own “pursuables”. For
example, From a young age I always loved to play with computers. I never knew
how they worked but I was always aware of their complexity and the amount of man
hours it took to create the machine that I am typing at. But to my child-like
bliss of ignorance, I never took it upon myself to learn it in my early years.
So deciding to study computers became a curiosity rather than a passion. And as
I am nearing the end of my Computer Engineering academic career, I have a
better—yet not complete—idea of what a computer is. And I also think I have
procured a passion for using computers to make our lives easier. But I am also
aware that I am highly interested in things that lie outside of the intersection
of everything computers.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-the-right-thing">Is this the right thing?</h2>
<p>There are so many issues that are deeply embedded in today’s society such as
racism and mental illnesses that still need to be solved. Can working on
computers help solve these problems? Well, maybe, I think. It depends on what
you choose to do with your knowledge of computers.</p>

<h2 id="getting-inspired">Getting inspired</h2>
<p>Recently, while working on a research project for one my classes and trying to
devise an algorithm to do something, I realized how deep this field is and how
many things are still yet to be discovered / improved. It inspires me to read
research papers where people have devoted countless hours to improving the
efficiency of memory representation. But then I come across someone who loves to
just spend their time making videos and listens to awesome music and I become
just as inspired. So what am I really interested in? Exploring the technical
field of computers or honing and more “artsy” skill that makes me feel all warm
inside.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-want-to-do">What do I want to do?</h2>
<p>A part of me knows that becoming good at everything is not viable, but another
part of me feels that if I have a passion for something, simply pursue it. But
is pursuing a passion a destined path for happiness in that field? Maybe not,
and probably not I feel, so maybe its best to just enjoy the hard work of others
and simply extract as much learning from them as possible. And maybe this
learning can somehow reflect the way I approach my own pursuable passion.</p>

<h2 id="pursuable-passion">Pursuable Passion</h2>

<h2 id="is-it-enough-to-just-do-or-do-we-also-have-to-show-to-be-fulfilled">Is it enough to just do or do we also have to show to be fulfilled?</h2>
<p>One question that I ask myself is that if I pursue any sort of creative passion
such as music or film making, it is enough to just do it or will I only feel
fulfilled if I show it to others. Social media has made it so easy to simply
click and share your work with almost anyone who wants to see your work. I
previously thought that the sharing portion of creation is the most fulfilling
part of it. I mean…why do directors make movies or musicians make music?
Because they not only enjoy making it, they want to see other people enjoy it as
well. Humans derive a lot of happiness from the happiness of others. I can see
this in my own relationships and way of pursing life.</p>
